Important Instructions:

Before running curl -s localhost:8080 | jq it is important to first start the server by running node src/server.js otherwise it wouldn't work.
npm install --save-dev nodemon (we have used --save-dev here because it is a development dependency).
After verifying that the code is working it is a good practice to commit the changes made to the files.
